# My Research Proposal for COMM783


### Summary
Messages that use language related to physical actions (walking, running, stretching) have been shown to activate areas of the brain involved in motor control. Individuals with greater experience (both as participants and regular observers) of specific physical movements, such as a certain sport, show greater activation in these same motor control regions. Higher levels of motor cortex activity during exposure to physical activity messages is associated with a higher likelihood of behavior change in levels of physical activity. This project will seetk to understand the associations between action words, experience of actions, PA behavior change and neural activity in motor regions though use of fNIRS (a low cost non-invasive neuroimaging technique). And will test potential priming interventions (linguistic and physical) to see if they can lead to more effective targeting of health interventions to sedentary individuals.
